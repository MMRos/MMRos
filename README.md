<h1 align="center" >Hi, Marc here</h1>

### My situation
I'm currently working on a non-coding job looking to get into this world. Nonetheless, I've got some projects I'm working on, some of them may be found as public repositories. 

### My knowledge
I've learned JS (mostly React), Python (Pandas, NumPy, React-Py), coded on Google Workspace, have some experience with Django and aiming to learn more about data bases (already know MySQL workbench).

### Goals
**Short-mid term:** Right now I'm looking for challenges that help me gather experience.
**Long term:** I'd like to get a better grasp on machinelearning and AI developement. 

### Relevant Project
During my studies I created some apps/webs. There are two that I believe are the most relevant:
* I have already worked a bit on <a href="https://github.com/MMRos/ChatGPT_Python">ChatGPT</a> integration and usage through an API Key. This one requires a bit of a setup explainned on the ReadMe.  
* I also created with a bit of React a simple web that allowed to create a navbar which shows whatever things you are buying. This one's called <a href="https://github.com/MMRos/Shopping-Cart">Shopping Cart</a>.

Also, I've been working on some other projects on my own:
* One of them is a simple app with a bit of fantasy flavour to it that reads you some <a href="https://github.com/MMRos/runes_LN_python">Runes</a>. It allows you to choose through a small variety of readings. The app explains them to you. 
* Another one is a work in progress to create a <a href="[https://github.com/MMRos/hoja_ln2](https://github.com/MMRos/hoja-ln2)">Character Sheet</a> for a ttrpg of my doing. This one's in spanish.
