### Hi, Marc here

## My situation
I'm currently working on a non-coding job looking to get into this world. Nonetheless, I've got some projects I'm working on, some of them may be found as public repositories. 

## My knowledge
I've learned JS (mostly React), Python (Pandas, NumPy, React-Py), coded on Google Workspace, have some experience with Django and aiming to learn more about data bases (already know MySQL workbench).

## Goals
**Short-mid term:** Right now I'm looking for challenges that help me gather experience.
**Long term:** I'd like to get a better grasp on machinelearning and AI developement.
